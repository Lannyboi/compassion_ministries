                <p class="bio bio-text">Larry Crawford, our current Chairman of the Board of Directors, was raised in rural Western Oregon. 
                    He attended Eddyville School all twelve years. He recognized his sinful heart condition and that
                    Jesus Christ died on the cross for his sin at age six. He was influenced and nurtured in his Christian
                    growth by the local church and Sunday School teachers, Pastors, and coaches. He played football,
                    basketball, and baseball in high school. He loves the outdoors and has spent hours hunting, fishing,
                    and working on cars. He went to college at OTT in Klamath Falls, Portland Community College and 
                    Multnomah’s MDiv program for 2 years. <br> <span class="bio-cont">Larry married his high school sweetheart, Leona, in 1972. They
                    have two children, Carri and Jachen. Both are married, and he is blessed to have six grandchildren,
                    ages 2 to 18 years in age. He served as a youth director in a small church, taught classes and
                    served on an Elder Board at Montavilla Baptist in Portland. Larry pastored Peoria Bible Church for 22
                    years. He worked as a general contractor of residential homes for 35 years, and is now retired from
                    contracting, instead utilizing his skills in serving people and the church. He enjoys serving people
                    and using his gifts to grow God’s kingdom. He also finds building projects and restoration of
                    old houses and cars rewarding. Larry doesn’t see retirement addressed in Scripture. He and his wife will
                    keep on serving people until God calls them home.</span>
